这个项目的目的是将屏幕的动作录制下来并执行，可以将录制下来的操作转换成vbs
这样更方便启动、运输，执行前会等待1.5s
主要是拿来给我们大学生更方便搭建自动化刷网课用的，当然也可以抢东西，不过一般来说抢不过就是了
感谢 https://blog.csdn.net/qq_27469815/article/details/84065999 的作者，虽然python部分也有很大部分是来源于另外一个作者，但是我找不到他了
还有很多兼容性问题无法处理，后续应该会更新

The purpose of this project is to record and execute the actions of the screen, and the recorded actions can be converted into VBS
This is more convenient to start and transport, and it will wait for 1.5s before execution
It is mainly used to make it more convenient for us college students to build automated online classes, of course, you can also grab things, but generally speaking, you can't grab it
Thanks to the author of https://blog.csdn.net/qq_27469815/article/details/84065999, although the python part is also very much from another author, but I can't find him
There are still a lot of compatibility issues that can't be handled, and they should be updated in the future
